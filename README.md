## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My major learning while working through this project was figuring out the @media screen. This is my first time using @media screen, had to research and adjust the CSS code appropiately.


```css
@media screen (width >= 769px)
    body{
        background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        transform: translate(0%, 30%);
    }
```
### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing flexbox and @media screen with future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me for @media screen because it provided a variety of codes for diferrent features. I really liked the resource and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is another site I use for the flexbox. It provided a few simple concept to understand what I needed to do with flexbox.
